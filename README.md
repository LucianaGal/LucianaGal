- 🏷 Extra info:
Driven by discovery and practical thinking. I’m a Data Analyst with a background in business operations and a strong instinct for finding patterns and meaning in data.

After nearly ten years managing a company and leading teams, I shifted into analytics to connect structure with insight.

I work closely with people to help them understand and use their data. From retail managers in Buenos Aires, to decision-making research with Vixon, a company focused on neuroscience in sports. Or financial advisors in Australia looking to track performance with clarity.

I learn new tools quickly. I adapt easily to different teams and ways of working. I bring focus and simplicity to complex questions.
